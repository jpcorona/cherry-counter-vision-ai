# 🍒 Vision AI for Automatic Cherry Counting

## Project Description
This project implements a **computer vision system** for **automatic cherry counting** on a **simulated production line**.  

The base video was **generated with Artificial Intelligence**, simulating a conveyor belt with cherries moving at industrial speed. This synthetic scenario allows controlled experimentation without relying on sensitive industrial data.  

The first approach uses **color segmentation in HSV space** to detect and count cherries. On top of this baseline, more advanced AI models such as **YOLOv8/YOLO11** are integrated and compared for **real-time object detection**.  

Key metrics evaluated include:
- **Counting accuracy**  
- **Frame rate (FPS)**  
- **Occupancy of the conveyor belt**  
- **Stability of detections**  

This project is part of the **Master in Information Technology at Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM, Chile)**, showcasing AI applications in the agro-industrial sector.

## Objectives
- Automate the counting of cherries on a conveyor belt.  
- Compare classical computer vision (HSV segmentation) with modern deep learning (YOLO).  
- Provide **real-time metrics and logging** for industrial monitoring.  
- Contribute to **digital transformation and quality control optimization** in agro-industry.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **OpenCV** (color segmentation, video processing, visualization)  
- **NumPy** (image operations and metrics)  
- **Ultralytics YOLO** (real-time object detection models)  
- **AI-generated synthetic video** simulating cherries on a conveyor belt

## Example Metrics on Screen
- **Total Count**: accumulated cherries detected  
- **Detections (per frame)**: objects detected in the current frame  
- **Occupancy %**: percentage of the conveyor belt occupied by cherries  
- **FPS**: processing speed in frames per second  
- **Time**: elapsed time in video  
- **Estimated Precision %**: confidence/consistency of detections

## Results & Expected Impact
- Accuracy > **95%** compared to manual counting  
- Real-time performance at **15–25 FPS**  
- Reduction of manual counting time by **80%**  
- Potential scalability to other fruits (grapes, blueberries)
